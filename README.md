# Blood-Pressure-Estimation-from-PPG-Signals-
Blood Pressure Estimation from PPG Signals Using Hybrid CNN–BiLSTM Deep Learning Model
Personal Research Project | 2025

Designed and implemented a deep learning pipeline for continuous blood pressure estimation from Photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals.

Performed signal preprocessing, including baseline wander removal and denoising using wavelet transforms.

Generated CWT scalograms for visual time–frequency feature representation.

Developed and trained a Hybrid CNN–BiLSTM model for systolic and diastolic BP prediction using data from 122 test subjects.

Achieved strong correlation and low MAE between predicted and reference arterial blood pressure (ABP) values.

Tools & Technologies: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, PyWavelets.
